On our patient page add an icon chart-line from https://materialdesignicons.com/
    import { mdiChartLine } from '@mdi/js';

When user clicks that icon then open modal dialog marker.png
    
    Initial Page Load:

        select name
        from cpt 
        where id = $cptid
        
        Use that name to set the modal dialog title

        select functional_range
        from client
        where id = $clientid
        
        this value will be used later
    
    The Left and Right arrows:

        Left and Right arrow go to previous and next test on the list.

        select c.id, c.name from (
        select distinct lc.cpt_id
        from lab_cpt lc
        where lc.patient_id=${req.patient_id}
        ) lc
        left join cpt c on c.id=lc.cpt_id
        order by c.name
        limit 200
        
        If at first test on list then grey out and deactivate the Left arrrow.  
        If at last then grey out and deactivate the Right arrrow.
        
        ****Every time there is a new data set so set a new scale on the graph.
        There are around 100 data sets.
        Every graph must be 100% pixel perfect.
        Do not let scale be under 0.
        Mostly the data is the range for example of 50 to 100.
        Sometimes it is like 1.005 to 1.025 etc

    Graph:
        select lc.lab_id, lc.lab_dt, lc.cpt_id, lc.value, lc.range_low, lc.range_high, lc.unit, l.filename, lc.client_id
        from lab_cpt lc
        left join lab l on l.id=lc.lab_id
        where lc.patient_id=${req.patient_id}
        and lc.cpt_id='{$cptid}'
        order by lc.lab_dt, lc.lab_id
        limit 500

        Columns lc.range_low and lc.range_high are called the conventional range

    If client.functional_range==True then display the functional range lines on the graph.
        The functional range values come from /clinios/client/src/utils/FunctionalRange.js

    If client.functional_range==True
        if /clinios/client/src/utils/FunctionalRange.js has a functional range
            when line is inside the functional range then line color green, else orange
        else
            when line is inside the conventional range then line color green, else orange
    else
        when line is inside the conventional range then line color green, else orange

    When mouse hover a dot on the graph then display the temporary popup shown

    When Button 3 months, 6 months etc. is clicked then adjust date range of graph
